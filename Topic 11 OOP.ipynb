    "So far we looked into the Procedural/ functional programming aspect of python where we were writing programs made of functions that perform specific tasks. These procedures/functions typically operate on data items that are separate from the procedures. For example, we passed data items as argument to these proceduces and returned some data item from the functions. This return item can be then passed to another function to operate on. So, here the focus was on creating procedures/functions that operate on the programâ€™s data.\n",

    "## The basics of OOP\n",
    "In object oriented programming, we try to solve the problem using objects. So, what is an object?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object: Objects are a representation of the real world objects like cars, bicycles, bikes, etc. \n",
    "The objects share two main characteristics: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data and (in OOP we call this ATTRIBUTE) \n",
    "2. Behavior. (in OOP we call this METHOD)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, We want to write a program to store the information about the employees in a software company. Here each of the employees is an object. All the employees have a first name, last name, email address, pay. These are some attributes of the employees. \n",
    "\n",
    "In OOP, we define object methods to execute on the object's attribute(s) to perform certain task for the object. For example, one of the methods can be calculate_salary() that takes in a increase_amount as parameter and returns the salary for a particular employee.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of combining the data attributes and the methods operating on these attributes to an object is called encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important terminology is 'CLASS'. For the previous example, any employee of the company is an employee or they belong to the employee class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, a class is a blueprint of objects that share the common attributes (but with different values). Using this definition of class we can also say that an object is an instance (with some particular values) of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to analyze these definitions with some example. Employee is a class that contains/generalizes the characteristics of any employee in a company. The general attribute of an employee can be first_name, last_name, email, pay etc. However, Sam and Jake are two employees. For Sam and Jake the attribute values are given below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Jake:\n",
    "1. first_name = James\n",
    "2. last_name = Anderson\n",
    "3. email = james.anderson@company.com\n",
    "4. pay = 50000\n",

    "Sam:\n",
    "1. first_name = Samuel\n",
    "2. last_name = Gruber\n",
